<h1>Frameworks. Better</h1>
<p>
Frameworks are designed to help, but end up with a load of unneccessary bloat which makes your life a lot harder. 
</p>
<p>
Nuclear fixes that.
</p>
<p>
It's a plain bootstrapper where you can import your own modules, at your own accord. It fully performs to your
needs and accommodates your need for change. 
</p>
<p>
Don't like Module A and prefer it's alternative Module B? Remove A and in goes B! Nuclear focuses on lightweight
customisability and having your modules swappable.

<h2 class="first">Rapid Loading</h2>

Nuclear doesn't faff about with creating services, controllers, making new objects. It just loads your code and lets the code run.

<h2 class="second">Custom Networking</h2>

Nuclear offers a Networking library called [Red](https://github.com/red-blox/Red), a "Simple, fast and powerful networking library". However, we don't tie you down to this and allow for easy changes to whichever networking library you may use!

We like our customisability at Nuclear, and it's what
our users deserve.
