<h1>Frameworks. Better</h1>
<p>
Frameworks are designed to help, but end up with a load of unneccessary bloat which makes your life a lot harder. 
</p>
<p>
Nuclear fixes that.
</p>
<p>
It's just a boostrapper, and it's all frameworks really should be. Frameworks like Knit come with utilities that increase the framework's
size and also some cannot be removed as they are a core part of the framework.

<h2 class="first">Rapid Loading</h2>

Nuclear doesn't faff about with creating services, controllers, making new objects. It just loads your code and lets the code run.

<h2 class="second">Accessibility</h2>

Newer programmers tend to use multiple scripts and localscripts for their code. This is generally a bad idea and Nuclear
makes it easy for Newer Programmers to convert to Single-Script architecture.

<h2 class="third">Not tied down</h2>

Some frameworks force you to have modules that you may not want. Nuclear removes this faff together by
not coming with modules to create an ultra-lightweight bootstrapper and make it much easier to add and remove what you want.

## Sparked your curiosity?

These are only three of the benefits of using Nuclear. They're our basic main foundations
for development and how we aim to create a future of well-written, robust code which
isn't infested with slow and buggy tools powering the framework.
