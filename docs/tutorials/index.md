# Getting Started

Welcome, thank you for trying Nuclear! Here, you will
learn all things about Nuclear and what it entails. It's dead easy, so all
newcomers are welcome!

!!! caution "But first, something important..."
	**<span style="font-size: 1.5em; color: var(--nuclear-accent);">
	Nuclear is in *ALPHA*! Do not use Nuclear unless you are willing to
    have your code rapidly change as we release new versions.
	</span>**

	As we are in Alpha. You *will* experience:

	- bugs in core features
	- updates that completely remove existing features
	- changes in behaviour between versions
	- changing advice on coding conventions and how to structure your project

	Don't be discouraged from using Nuclear! It still has most core functionalities
    in place.

# Expectations

Firstly, lets set some ground rules.

- You should be *somewhat* familiar with the luau scripting language.
- You're familiar with how your desired tooling works. If you're using roblox, be familiar with how to import
to roblox.
  
We don't expect experts here! You should just know the basics.
