# Nuclear
The only module loader you need. 

## What is Nuclear
It's a simple module loader, but it contains all the networking and utilities one may need. All open sourced!

## Why Nuclear?
The most well-known module loader / framework is probably Knit, which has a lot of over-engineered things and it's not super performant. 
That's where Nuclear comes in. Nuclear does what a simple framework should do, without the unneccessary bloat.
