# Nuclear
The only module loader you need. 

## What is Nuclear
It's a simple bootstrapper. You just run a line of code and it loads your code. You don't need any unneccessary service or controller creation garbage.

## Why Nuclear?
Need something that is customisable and easy to use? Use Nuclear! Nuclear is similar to Knit, it loads your modules. However, Nuclear doesn't contain a range of modules. 
It also removes a lot of boilerplate. You need to specify names, client tables, creating services and controllers in Knit. Forget that. Nuclear just has one line of code
to load your scripts and two functions to start your modules. Init and Start.
